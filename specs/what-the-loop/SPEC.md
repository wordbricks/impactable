# WhatTheLoop Spec

This document aims to define and implement the WhatTheLoop (WTL) interface,
and to implement the WTL CLI as its minimal working implementation.

WTL ("WhatTheLoop") is a proposed shared loop interface for agent execution.

This document is intentionally language- and runtime-agnostic. It defines only
the **behavioral contract** that an implementation must satisfy, without
prescribing classes, interfaces, method names, or language-specific mechanics.

The Quint models in this directory are reference artifacts for the design.
They have already been typechecked, simulated, and bounded-verified.
Implementers are not required to repeat these steps.

## Overview

WTL defines "how to run the loop" when executing a single agent task.
Three roles collaborate:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Run                            │
│                                                     │
│   ┌──────────┐   directive   ┌──────────┐           │

│   └────┬─────┘               └──────────┘           │

│   ┌──────────┐                                      │
│   │ Observer │  (logs, metrics, UI — read-only)     │
│   └──────────┘                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Engine**: runs the loop. starts turns, enforces limits, terminates.
- **Policy**: decides meaning. interprets turn results and issues the next directive.
- **Observer**: notifies the outside world of state changes. does not affect execution.

The goal is to let different workflows share one engine while each using a different policy.

## Glossary

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Run** | One WTL execution, from initialization to termination |
| **Turn** | One invocation of the agent runtime by the engine |
| **Directive** | The next action instruction issued by the policy to the engine |
| **Phase** | A semantically distinct stage within a run |
| **Terminal outcome** | The final result of a run: `completed` or `exhausted` |
| **Phase-scoped thread reuse** | A policy may either reuse the current logical thread for a phase or start a new one when entering a phase |
| **Compaction** | Context compression performed by the engine when context grows too large |
| **External wait** | A paused state while waiting for external input such as user action |

---

## Three Roles

### Engine

The engine is responsible for **loop mechanics**.

Must do:
- Initialize the run and logical thread state
- Start turns and detect their completion
- Enforce iteration and retry limits
- Perform compaction when needed
- Create, reuse, or replace the active logical thread according to the policy's execution plan
- Terminate in a terminal state
- Notify observers of lifecycle events

Must not do:
- **Decide on its own** what a turn result means. That decision belongs to the policy.

### Policy

The policy is responsible for **workflow meaning**.

Must do:
- Define its own internal state
- Receive turn outcomes and decide the next directive
- Determine the current run state (continue, wait, retry, complete, etc.)
- Provide the execution plan for the next turn, including phase identity, prompt or instruction, and thread reuse mode
- Validate whether completion is allowed

Must not do:
- **Directly control execution mechanics** such as dispatching turns or invoking observers. The policy specifies intent; the engine performs the mechanics.

### Observer

The observer is a **passive listener**.

May receive notifications for:
- run start
- phase change
- thread started / reused
- turn start / finish
- wait entry
- terminal completion / exhaustion

May do: log, record metrics, update UI, write audit records, emit traces

Must not do: control the execution flow. An observer's behavior must not be a
correctness dependency for the loop.

---

## Directives

Instructions issued by the policy to the engine. The engine treats them as authoritative.

| Directive | Meaning | When it occurs |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `continue` | Proceed to the next turn in the current phase | Turn completed normally and work can continue |
| `wait` | Wait for external input. No new turns may start | An external event such as user approval or input is needed |
| `retry` | Retry the last turn in the same phase | The turn failed but the error is recoverable |
| `compact` | Compress context before continuing | Context is too large to proceed as-is |
| `advance_phase` | Move to the next phase and install a new execution plan | The current phase goal is achieved and the next stage begins |
| `complete` | Terminate the run successfully | The policy has explicitly approved completion |

---

## Lifecycle

The full flow of a single run:

```
[Init]
  initialize engine state
  initialize policy state
  → emit run-start event

[Loop]
  is policy runnable?
  ├── no (waiting) → wait for external input → deliver input to policy → re-enter loop
  └── yes → start turn
               turn completes
               deliver result to policy
               receive directive
               ├── continue       → next turn (repeat loop)
               ├── wait           → enter waiting state
               ├── retry          → retry in same phase
               ├── compact        → compact then continue
               ├── advance_phase  → move to next phase, update prompt and thread plan, repeat loop
               └── complete       → [terminate: completed]

  iteration/retry limit reached → [terminate: exhausted]
```

An observer event is emitted on every transition.

---

## Engine-Policy Contract

### On Initialization

Before the first turn, the engine requests the initial state from the policy.
The initial policy state must define:

- Whether the run is immediately executable or requires phase initialization first
- Initial completion / wait / planning state
- The initial execution plan for the first turn

### Execution Plan

The policy must provide an execution plan for every runnable turn. The plan must
include at least:

- phase identity
- prompt or instruction content for the next turn
- thread mode: reuse current thread or start a new thread
- any optional execution metadata the host needs to interpret, such as prompt kind or sandbox class

The engine owns the actual thread lifecycle, but must honor the plan's thread mode.

### Before Each Turn

The engine checks the current execution context from the policy state:

- Can a turn start?
- Is the run in a waiting state?
- Is the run already terminal?
- What prompt or instruction should be sent for this turn?
- Should the current phase reuse the existing thread or start a new one?

### After Each Turn

The engine delivers the turn outcome to the policy. The policy responds with one of the directives above and, when needed, an updated execution plan for the next turn or phase.

### On Wait Resolution

When external input arrives after a `wait` directive, the engine delivers it to
the policy. The policy may return to a runnable state or remain blocked.

### Completion Validation

A run must not terminate as `completed` unless the policy explicitly issues `complete`.
If the policy rejects completion, the engine must continue or wait per the returned directive.

---

## Engine State Model

An implementation must represent the following states or their semantic equivalents:

```
idle → ready → turn started → turn running
                                    │
              ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
              ▼                     ▼                     ▼
          waiting              compacting          (directive handling)
              │                     │                     │
              └──────────────────── ┴──────────────────── ┘
                                    │
                        ┌───────────┴───────────┐
                        ▼                       ▼
                    completed               exhausted
```

Required invariants:

- iteration count must never exceed the configured maximum
- if the policy selects thread reuse for the current phase, thread identity must remain stable until the policy changes phase or requests a new thread
- prompt or instruction identity may change between turns; it must not be assumed constant across a whole run
- in waiting state, the current directive must be `wait`
- in completed state, the current directive must be `complete`

---

## Policy State Model

WTL does not restrict how policies are implemented. The two below are examples.
Any policy that satisfies the directive contract may be freely defined.

### Interactive Completion Policy (example)

Suitable for tasks that require waiting for user input or approval.

```
active ──────────────────────────────► completed
  │                                       ▲
  ├── waiting for user input ─(arrived)───┤
  ├── waiting for login      ─(authed)────┤
  └── completion rejected    ─(retry)─────┘
                                      (limit reached → exhausted)
```

Required properties:
- completion is invalid unless explicitly approved
- completion is not allowed while waiting for input
- waiting state must emit the `wait` directive

### Phased Delivery Policy (example)

Suitable for tasks that must progress through ordered stages.

```
idle → init → planning → implementing → review → completed
                                                      │
                                             (limit reached → exhausted)
```

Required properties:
- planning cannot begin before init prerequisites are met
- implementing cannot begin before a plan exists
- review cannot begin before delivery is complete
- terminal completion requires an explicit `complete` directive

---

## Observer Contract

Observers consume lifecycle events emitted by the engine.

Required guarantees:

- `run-start` must occur before any other event
- `turn-finished` count must never exceed `turn-started` count
- no non-terminal events may be emitted after a terminal event
- `completed` and `exhausted` are mutually exclusive within a single run

Each event payload is implementation-defined, but must carry enough information
for downstream consumers to correlate:

- run identity
- phase identity (if applicable)
- turn identity (if applicable)
- terminal outcome (if applicable)
- wait reason (if applicable)

---

## Error Model

A run does not give up early. The engine and policy must keep finding ways to
proceed until a limit is reached.

WTL distinguishes two outcomes:

| Kind | Description | Engine behavior |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Recoverable failure** | A turn failure that can be retried | Retry if policy issues `retry` |
| **Exhaustion** | Iteration or retry limit reached | Terminate as `exhausted` |

Even if they share the same internal exception mechanism, these two must be
distinguishable in external reporting.

---

## State Ownership

WTL does not require a specific persistence mechanism, but ownership must be clear:

| Owner | Owns |
|-------|------|
| **Engine** | loop control, iteration count, active thread lifecycle, retry/wait mechanics |
| **Policy** | workflow meaning, completion gating, phase ordering, prompt selection, and thread reuse boundaries |
| **Observer** | logs, metrics, UI, traces, audit records |

The engine must not depend on observer behavior. The policy may request
persistence through the host application.

---

## Model Scope

Properties verified by the current Quint models:

- iteration does not exceed the configured limit
- when a phase requests thread reuse, the active thread remains stable
- a phase transition may either reuse the current thread or start a new one
- completion requires explicit approval
- completion is not possible while waiting
- phase ordering is enforced (review only after delivery)
- no non-terminal events after a terminal event
- `turn-finished` count does not exceed `turn-started` count

Properties not verified by the current models:

- artifact contents
- SQL/query correctness
- git commit materialization
- browser/MFA interactions
- CLI rendering or log formatting

# WTL CLI

The minimal implementation of the WTL interface. The goal is to implement the
WTL interface as a working CLI tool.

---

## Pre-Implementation Requirements

> **[Must ask the user before starting implementation]**
>
> The coding agent implementing this spec must ask the user the following two
> questions before beginning:
>
> 1. **"Which programming language would you like to use?"**
>    (e.g. Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, etc.)
>
> 2. **"Which agent runtime would you like to use?"**
>    (e.g. Claude API, OpenAI API, local LLM, Codex App Server, etc.)
>    The answer determines the TurnRunner implementation and log output behavior.
>
> Begin implementation only after receiving answers to both questions.

---

## User Interface

### Running the CLI

```
wtl run
```

Flags:

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--max-iter` | Maximum number of iterations | 20 |
| `--max-retry` | Maximum retries per turn | 3 |

### Execution Flow

```
$ wtl run
> Enter your request: [user input]

[turn 1] running...
<agent runtime output>

[turn 2] running...
<agent runtime output>

Done: your request was completed successfully.
```

### Input

- The prompt is read from stdin at startup
- The initial user request is held constant for the entire run in the minimal CLI
- Policies may still derive a different per-turn instruction or prompt wrapper from that same user request

### Log Output

- Print `[turn N] running...` at the start of each turn
- Stream agent runtime responses to stdout as they arrive
- Log verbosity may vary depending on the agent runtime implementation

### Exit

| Condition | Output | Exit code |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Completion detected | `Done: your request was completed successfully.` | 0 |
| Limit reached | `Stopped: maximum iterations reached.` | 1 |
| Interrupt (Ctrl+C) | `Stopped: user interrupt.` | 130 |

---

## Completion Marker Protocol

### Overview

The policy detects a completion marker in the agent runtime's response to issue
a `complete` directive. The agent runtime must include the marker in its response
when it determines the user's request is fully complete.

### Marker Format

```
##WTL_DONE##
```

- Position within the response does not matter (beginning, middle, or end)
- Case-sensitive
- When detected, the remainder of the turn's response is still printed normally

### Agent Runtime Instruction Requirement

The system prompt or instruction passed to the agent runtime must include:

```
When you determine that the task is fully complete, include ##WTL_DONE## at the
end of your response. Do not include it if the task is still in progress or
requires additional steps.
```

---

## SimpleLoopPolicy

The policy used by this CLI. Operates as a single loop with no phase distinction.

| Condition | Directive |
|-----------|-----------|
| Response contains `##WTL_DONE##` | `complete` |
| Turn failed (error occurred) | `retry` |
| Otherwise | `continue` |

---

## Observer

The CLI registers an observer that handles the following events:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `TurnStarted` | Print `[turn N] running...` |
| `TurnFinished` | Print agent response |
| `RunCompleted` | Print completion message, exit 0 |
| `RunExhausted` | Print limit-reached message, exit 1 |

---

## Out of Scope

Items not covered by this CLI implementation:

- wait/resume (external input handling) — future extension
- phase-based execution — future extension
- multi-turn conversation history — delegated to agent runtime implementation
- authentication, config files — delegated to agent runtime implementation
